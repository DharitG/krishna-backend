# LangChain + Composio Integration

This document describes the integration of LangChain with Composio in the backend architecture of the August AI Super Agent.

## Overview

This integration uses JavaScript libraries to create a powerful agent-based architecture that can leverage external tools through Composio. The implementation is fully JavaScript-based and avoids any Python dependencies.

## Components

### 1. LangChain Service

Located at: `/src/services/langchain.service.js`

This service:
- Connects to Composio using the `LangchainToolSet` from `composio-core`
- Creates and manages LangChain agents with Azure OpenAI
- Handles user authentication for various services
- Processes messages through the LangChain agent

### 2. Updated Chat Controller

The chat controller has been modified to:
- Use the LangChain service instead of directly calling OpenAI
- Maintain the same error handling and response format

### 3. Authentication Check Route

A new route and controller method have been added to:
- Check if tools require authentication before using them
- Return redirect URLs for any services that need authentication
- Extract service names from tool identifiers

## Dependencies

The following dependencies have been added to the project:
- `composio-core`: For Composio integration
- `@langchain/openai`: For OpenAI integration with LangChain
- `langchain`: Core LangChain functionality
- `langchain-core`: Core LangChain types and utilities

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your Azure OpenAI API key
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`: Your Azure OpenAI deployment name
- `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`: Your Composio API key

## Usage

### Backend

The backend is now set up to process messages through LangChain and Composio. No changes to the API endpoints are required.

### Mobile App

The mobile app should be updated to:
1. Check if tools need authentication before sending messages
2. Handle authentication redirects for services that require it

## Testing

To test the integration:
1. Start the backend server: `npm start`
2. Test with a simple chat message that doesn't require tools
3. Test with a tool that requires authentication (e.g., GitHub) to verify the authentication flow

## Benefits

- **Fully JavaScript-Based**: No need for Python or mixed backends
- **Mature Libraries**: LangChain and Composio both have stable JavaScript support
- **Simplified Architecture**: The backend handles all the complex logic
- **Reuse Existing Code**: Built on the existing backend structure
- **Authentication Flow**: Proper handling of service authentication
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add more tools and capabilities as needed
